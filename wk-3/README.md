#### Dependency Injection (DI) & Autowiring

- Create two simple Java classes:
    - `UserService`: This service interacts with a user repository (simulated for now).
    - `UserController`: This controller receives user data from requests and delegates operations to the UserService.
- Implement DI in UserService:
Define a constructor that takes a  `UserRepository` dependency.
- Implement autowiring in UserController:
Annotate the UserService dependency with `@Autowired`.


#### Spring Beans & Configuration

- Create a Spring Boot application with a basic `@SpringBootApplication` annotated class.
- Define a simple UserRepository interface (simulating user data access).
- Implement a UserService class as a Spring bean using `@Service` annotation:
    - Inject the UserRepository dependency using autowiring.

#### Unit Testing with JUnit

- Create a JUnit test class for your UserService:
    - Use @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) annotation.
- Write unit tests for UserService methods (e.g., creating or finding users):
    - Use mock objects (e.g., Mockito) to simulate the UserRepository behavior.
    - Assert expected outcomes using JUnit assertions.


#### Building a Spring CRUD Application

- Implement a simple User model class with relevant attributes.
- Create an in-memory UserRepository class (simulating data access):
    - Implement methods for CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on user data.
- Enhance your UserService:
    - Include methods to perform CRUD operations on users, delegating to the UserRepository.
- Implement a UserController (annotated with @RestController):
    - Define REST endpoints for CRUD operations on users (e.g., using `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`,`@PutMapping`,`@DeleteMapping`). * UseUserService` methods to perform CRUD operations within the controller methods.
- Run your Spring Boot application and test the implemented REST endpoints using tools like Postman or curl commands. Verify that you can create, read, update, and delete user data successfully.
