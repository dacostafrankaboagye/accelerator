### Array
* Create an application that manages a list of student
  names using an array.
* Implement functionalities to add, search, delete,
  and display student names.
  * Consider handling edge cases like array overflow
    when adding elements.

---

### Linked List
* Implement a basic linked list class to store integers.
* Include methods for adding elements to the beginning, end, or a specific
position within the list.
* Implement methods for searching and deleting elements from the linked list

---

### Stacks
* Simulate a simple calculator using a stack.
* The stack can store operands and operators.
* Implement functionalities for pushing elements onto the stack, popping
elements, and performing basic arithmetic operations `(+, -, *, /)` based on the
stack content.

---

### Queue
*  Design a program to simulate a task scheduler using a queue.
* The queue can store tasks (represented as strings) to be processed in a
 first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner.
* Implement functionalities for adding tasks to the queue, removing completed
   tasks, and displaying the current queue contents.

---

### Searching
* Implement `linear search` and `binary search` algorithms to find a specific
    element within an array.
* Compare the time complexity of both algorithms and discuss their use
    cases

### Sorting
* Implement `linear search` and `binary search` algorithms to find a specific
  element within an array.
* Compare the time complexity of both algorithms and discuss their use
  cases

### Spring Framework
* Create a basic Spring application with a bean definition for a message
service.
* Inject the message service into another bean and demonstrate its
usage.
* This exercise provides a hands-on introduction to Spring concepts like
dependency injection and bean configuration.
